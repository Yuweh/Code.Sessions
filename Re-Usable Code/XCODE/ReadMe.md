# Installing multiple versions of Xcode 

Xcode 8 and later (.xip):

Download. Download the .xip file.
Unarchive. Double click the .xip file in your Downloads folder to unarchive it.
Xcode 7 and earlier (.dmg):

Download. Download the .dmg file.
Install. Double click on the .dmg file. The installer suggests dragging Xcode.app to the Applications folder. If you already have an Xcode.app in /Applications (perhaps the Mac App Store version), don’t do that. Instead, drag it to your desktop.
Once you have an Xcode.app file:

Rename. Rename the Xcode.app file to include the version number (e.g. “Xcode8.3.2.app”) to identify the version and to set a unique filename. Downloads of beta versions of Xcode already have a unique name and this step is not required (unless you prefer to use an alternate name).
Move to /Applications. Drag the file to your Applications folder.
Only after the Xcode version has been renamed and moved to /Applications is it safe to launch it. Moving its location afterwards can cause problems. On first launch, Xcode sometimes prompts to install command line tools. It’s easiest to just let Xcode do that.

Repeat this process for each version of Xcode you want to install. Over time, you’ll build up a few versions and can remove those you no longer need. Xcode is a big app and uses a lot of disk space.
