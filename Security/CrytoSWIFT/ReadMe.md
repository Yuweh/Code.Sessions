# CryptoSwift

CryptoSwift is one of the most popular collections of many standard cryptographic algorithms written in Swift. Cryptography is difficult and needs to be done correctly to be useful. Using a popular library for security means you don’t have to be responsible for the implementation of standardized hashing functions.

FYI: Apple has a CommonCrypto framework that provides many useful hashing functions, but it’s not easy to interact with it in Swift
